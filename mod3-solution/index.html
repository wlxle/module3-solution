        Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:

        1.(If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.


        2.(If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.


        3.Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example,  module3-solution  or  mod3_solution , etc. Create an  index.html  file inside the solution container folder, e.g.,  module3-solution/index.html .


        4.The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menu dropdown shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.


        5.Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a  css  folder under the solution container folder, e.g.,  module3-solution/css .


        6.For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you've cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the  examples/Lecture25  folder. Copy the contents of  examples/Lecture25  to your solution container folder (e.g.,  module3-solution ) as a starting point..


        7.Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e.,  md ,  sm , and  xs .
        ◦Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap  md -based classes
        ◦Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap  sm -based classes
        ◦Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap  xs -based classes


        8.Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page, i.e., the default one that does not stay in the same place when the page scrolls. The navbar should have a company name (i.e.,  navbar-brand  class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See (http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) ttp://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar. Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.) 

         For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should be visible. (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class on the button that activates the dropdown.)


        9.Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

        1.(If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.
